# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 🚀  
This is where I’ll be publishing all the code and projects I create as I learn Python.

## 📌 About This Repo

This repository is a collection of:

- Practice exercises
- Mini projects
- Code snippets
- Notes and experiments

It’s a personal learning space, and I’ll be updating it regularly as I explore more of Python.

## 📁 Folder Structure (Planned)

📦python-Files
┣ 📂basics/
┣ 📂projects/
┣ 📂exercises/
┣ 📂notes/
┗ README.md

- `basics/` – Syntax, variables, loops, functions, etc.
- `projects/` – Mini projects I build along the way.
- `exercises/` – Practice problems and challenges.
- `notes/` – Notes, explanations, and useful tips.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- IDE: VS Code / PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: (as needed)

## 📖 What I'm Learning

Some of the topics I’ll cover:

- Python syntax and semantics
- Data structures and Algorithms(lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, graph, tree etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Modules and packages
- GUI development with Tkinter
- Web and API basics
- And more...

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This is a living repository. Everything here is part of my learning process — expect messy commits, bugs, and improvements over time!

## 🤝 Contributions

This is mostly for personal use, but if you have suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion!

Happy coding! 😄
